# Example: Training and saving a RandomForest model in Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pickle

# Assuming X_train and y_train are your training data and labels
crop_recommendation_model = RandomForestClassifier()
crop_recommendation_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model to a file
with open("models/RandomForest.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(crop_recommendation_model, f)
